            <p>1. Breathe in as slowly, deeply and gently as you can, through your nose.</p>
            <br>
            <p>2. Breathe out slowly, deeply and gently through your mouth</p>
            <br>
            <p>3. Count steadily from one to five on each in-breath and each out-breath.</p>
            <br>
            <p>4. Find 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.</p>
